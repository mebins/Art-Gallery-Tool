  "body": "### Welcome to Art Gallery Tool.\r\nArt Gallery Tool, is a math research tool I created to study analytical geometry in a coop undergraduate research project with my Professor Richard Low from SJSU. You construct a polygon of any shape which is your art gallery. Then you can place guards (with 360 degree sight) that can see through any amount of walls (default 0 walls). When computed, it will generate the line of sight of the guards.\r\n\r\n### PATCHES\r\nVersion 1.2 to Version 1.8\r\nVersion 1.8\r\n- Buttons are implemented,\r\n- Guard to any Nth power of vision is implemented.\r\n- No more gross GUI on the drawing window.\r\n- Removed certain hotkeys, kept most important ones.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.7\r\n-Snapshot exports to the desktop instead.\r\nVersion 1.6\r\n-Added Black outline on the guards\r\n-Created JPEG export to folder in C:\\\\ ArtGalleryExports\r\nVersion 1.5\r\n- Made the Saturation of lines more.\r\n- Guard can now be created to see any amount of walls(not only 1).\r\n- Created Java document (in the SRC).\r\n\r\nVersion 1.4\r\n-Fixed a problem where too many guards placed at a fast rate would catch.\r\n-Made it possible to place guards outside of the Gallery\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3\r\n-Computation Works\r\n-Guards Change Color\r\n-Window Resizable\r\n-Vertices are smaller\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2\r\n- Redid the code so now that things are in its own classes, such as\r\nGuards, Walls(instead of lines).\r\n\r\n- created guards that can create lines 360 degrees, but computation of those lines still to be figured out.\r\n\r\n",
